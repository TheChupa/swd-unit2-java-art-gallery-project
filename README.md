# swd-unit2-java-art-gallery-project
A multi-part project to teach LaunchCode students to build a Java web application with Spring Boot in conjunction with an SQL database.

### HOW TO USE THIS REPO
Unlike some of my other repos, I am building the entire finished project in the `main` branch.

For now, as I am working on adding more to the project, please do NOT fork and clone the repo. View different branches on GitHub to see the various stages of the project. I will update this README when I'm ready for you all to fork it!

~~If you wish to code the project from the beginning or from any point along the way, choose from several branches for the starter code. The starter code for most branches is essentially the solution to the previous branch, and `main` is the final solution.~~
